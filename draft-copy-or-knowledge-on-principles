# Why Being An Empowered Trader With Self-Custody, Collective Knowledge And Liquid Choice Matters

## Purpose

Returning control into the hands of the user and empowering everyone, that's the founding purpose of DeversiFi. Specifically, its team is guided by the principles of freedom of choice, of the knowledge to make informed decisions, and of the self-control of assets. Here's why you should be part of the story too, especially since DeversiFi preserves the upsides of CEXs that these ideals might normally impede.

## 1. Asset Self-Control

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) have had the control of users' assets, at the great peril of the long history of losses. Although some solutions are getting solid for professional custody, if cryptocurrency is to be about giving back more control to individuals and firms in the conduct of their life and business, a significant portion should be free from the trust costs of a centralized party.

Self-custody is the key pillar of DeversiFi for giving back control before other initiatives aiming at increasing self-control and empowerment, through a decentralised autonomous organization (DAO), necDAO. [https://support.deversifi.com/en/docs/51-what-is-a-dao-why-should-i-care] Although this may typically done through on-chain trading, DeversiFi's Validium layer-two technology preserves lightning speed, deep liquidity (both centralised and self-custodial), privacy by default (with optional on-chain transaction data in the future) and competitive fees in trading.

With this kind of scaling, you can trade as efficiently and seriously as on CEX, now with asset self-control.

## 2. Collective Knowledge

CEXs' control of information and decisionmaking is typically an inside job, for better or for worse. The users must trust the operators will act correctly and uphold the users' expectations, especially as it relates to their personal information and custody of holdings.

When decisionmaking relies in great part on a DAO and a decentralised system for the resolution of controversies (Kleros, which was used in the previous decentralised listing experiment), it opens up the wisdom of the serious traders and arbitrators that frequent them.

You can trade with more confidence about the correctness and upholding of expectations.

## 3. Community Choice

CEXs have the control to choose their direction in a top-down manner (for example, the listing and support of certain projects). The user's choice lies in the competition available and the desire to do business with a certain CEX, with only limited input about its future.

DeversiFi (formerly Ethfinex) is gradually transitioning towards decentralised governance through necDAO. While the operational organization is still with the original team, components of the DEX are increasingly being handed. They will be controlled by the Nectar (NEC) community, as set up on DAOStack with reputation being distributed. At its core, this means the community will be able to direct the support for listings and general projects shaping the future of the DEX. The faith in your investment and dependence in the ecosystem should be better secured with that possibility of voice and adjustment of your use of it.

It is preferable for you to join sooner rather than later to have a greater reputation and influence.

## Come Experience More Control

While these are some fundamental principles for control and features for serious traders, the future of the story will be shaped by your participation and feedback. The DeversiFi team and the necDAO are considering all needs and comments, so feel free and very welcome to come try DeversiFi, experience more control, and give your opinion!
